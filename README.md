In my childhood, I was captivated by screens, pondering what was happening inside them. This led me to pursue studies in Audiovisual Communication, followed by User Experience Design, and ultimately Frontend development. My curiosity and determination to comprehend how to infuse life and essence into an object have enabled me to communicate in various ways and discover intersections between my personal interests as I've grown both personally and professionally.
